The main focus of the club is to teach beginners how to code, but there will also be more advanced teachings offered to people that already have some coding knowledge. Some examples would be: tutoring for AP Computer Science A, as well as setting teams up for Hackathons.","Members of the club get together at lunchtime each Tuesday at the designated meeting room. Some executives will be in charge of teaching general lessons for everyone, while others may be helping with more advanced topics, or helping newcomers that are new to the club.",Academic: Your club acts to help students on their academic journey.,Tuesday,Lunchtime,link,tag,code,,,,,,fhsscodingclub@gmail.com
